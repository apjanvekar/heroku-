Hi! Welcome to the Readme for BXR. 

BXR is an open source, ruby on rails file management system. It is based off of
Boxroom, another ruby on rails application. BXR allows you to create folders, 
users, and groups, and assign permissions, so you can secure different folder 
and files. You can also search for files and folders, either by keyword, or by 
file content. Organization of files is easy! Besides being able to upload files 
to different folders, you can also add specific tags/labels to each file. 

Features 
  - Easy-To-Use User Interface
  - Create Users, Groups, and Folders
  - Assign Group Priveleges for File/Folder Protection
  - Tag/Label Files for better organization
  - Ferret Support for File Content Indexing & Searching

Installing 
  - Read the file INSTALL for more details. It's pretty easy!

Requirements
  - If you would like to use Ferret for file content searching and indexing,
    you must install the gems: 
	ferret
	acts_as_ferret
    Ferret indexing is disabled by default. To turn on Ferret indexing, open
    config/environment.rb and change the line:
	FERRET_ENABLED = false
		    to
	FERRET_ENABLED = true
    That's it!

    
How to use BXR
  - After installing BXR, just visit the application in your web browser, and log 
    in with the default username and password(see INSTALL for more info). The rest 
    is pretty self-explanatory!
